## I'm Jamie — hey! Thanks for stopping by 👋

I’m a software engineer who’s aiming for a **Product Support Engineer / Support Engineer** role. I like the intersection of **customer communication + debugging + building small tools/docs that reduce repeat issues**.

Right now I’m building **Seen** — a support-styled application page (chat thread + help center + quick actions) with a dashboard layer behind it. It’s my way of practicing the kind of UI and workflow I want to work in every day.

---

### What I'm looking for
- **Support Engineer / Product Support Engineer** roles (especially at startups)
- Teams where Support partners closely with **Engineering + Product**
- Work that mixes **investigation + communication + building improvements** (docs, tooling, workflow fixes)

---

### What I’m building / learning
- **TypeScript + Next.js** (shipping real features, not just tutorials)
- Support-coded UI patterns: **chat widgets, help centers, queues, macros**
- Debugging and ops fundamentals: **repro steps, evidence bundles, clear escalation handoffs**

### A good convo starter
If you’re in Support/Support Eng, I’m always curious:
- what your top repeat issue categories are
- what makes an escalation “great” for your engineers
- what you wish Support had shipped earlier (tooling/docs/process)
